# PureMVC Haxe Feathers UI Cafe Townsend

This demo of [PureMVC](http://puremvc.org/) and [Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/) was originally written for [Cairngorm](https://github.com/feathersui/feathersui-cairngorm), another framework for Feathers UI. It illustrates the handling of routine maintenance tasks on the client.

Based on [PureMVC ActionScript 3 Demo: Cafe Townsend (Flex)](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-as3-demo-flex-cafetownsend)

## Live demo

A build of the [_puremvc-haxe-demo-feathersui-cafe-townsend_ sample](https://feathersui.com/samples/haxe-openfl/puremvc/puremvc-haxe-demo-feathersui-cafe-townsend/) is hosted on the Feathers UI website, and it may be viewed in any modern web browser.

## Run locally

This project includes an [_project.xml_](https://lime.software/docs/project-files/xml-format/) file that configures all options for [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/). This file makes it easy to build from the command line, and many IDEs can parse this file to configure a Haxe project to use OpenFL.

### Prerequisites

- [Install Haxe 4.0.0 or newer](https://haxe.org/download/)
- [Install Feathers UI from Haxelib](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/installation/)

### Command Line

Run the [**openfl**](https://www.openfl.org/learn/haxelib/docs/tools/) tool in your terminal:

```sh
haxelib run openfl test html5
```

In addition to `html5`, other supported targets include `windows`, `mac`, `linux`, `android`, and `ios`. See [Lime Command Line Tools: Basic Commands](https://lime.software/docs/command-line-tools/basic-commands/) for complete details about the available commands.
